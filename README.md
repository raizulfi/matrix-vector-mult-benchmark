# Matrix vector multiplication Benchmark

This repo will includes matrix vector multipilcation in C and i'll benchmark time and space of the program

## Testing main program:

### How to run the code:
to run the program, Execute the command below in your terminal:
```c
make; ./main_test.out
```
## Results:


Both Iterative and Recursive method had the correct and same output. We'll be able to move on to benchmarking between them.

# Benchmarking
Now, we're able to benchmark the time and space complexity 

## Time complexity

### How to run the code:
to run the time complexity, Execute the command below in your terminal:

```c
make time; ./main_b_time.out
```
## results:

## Space complexity

### How to run the code:
to run the time complexity, Execute the command below in your terminal:

```c
make space; ./main_b_space.out
```
